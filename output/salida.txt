A WHILE loop will start, it will repeat as long as the condition x>5 holds true
The WHILE loop substatements are:
    You just got in an IF statement, with the condition x<8
    The IF substatements are: 
        You assign the value z+5 to the variable z
    The conditional IF structure is over
    You assign the value x+1 to the variable x
The WHILE loop substatements are over
