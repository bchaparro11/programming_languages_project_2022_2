A FOR loop will start 
The counter variable is x=0
The condition of the FOR loop is x<9
After each iteration x++
The FOR loop substatements are: 
You've assigned the value str+x to the variable str
You've assigned the value str+z to the variable str
You just got in an IF statement, with the condition x>=10
The IF substatements are: 
You've assigned the string "yoooooo what's up buddy" to the variable x
The conditional structure is over
The FOR loop has ended
