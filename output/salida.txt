You declare a let type variable x with value 2
You declare a let type variable y
A WHILE loop will start, it will repeat as long as the condition x<3 holds true
The WHILE loop substatements are:
    A WHILE loop nested at level 1 will start, it will repeat as long as the condition y<2 holds true
    The WHILE loop substatements are:
        You assign the value y+1 to the variable y
        A FOR loop nested at level 2 will start. The counter variable is z starting with value 1. The condition of the FOR loop is z<2. After each iteration z++
        The FOR loop substatements are: 
            You assign the string "Tola y maruja" to the variable x
        The level 2 FOR loop has ended
    The level 1 WHILE loop substatements are over
The WHILE loop substatements are over
