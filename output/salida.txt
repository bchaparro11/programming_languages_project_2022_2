You declare a let type variable x with value 0
A WHILE loop will start, it will repeat as long as the condition x<8 holds true
The WHILE loop substatements are:
    An IF ELSE statement nested at level 1, with the condition x==7
    The IF substatements are: 
        You print in console the string value "Last iteration"
        You assign the value 8 to the variable x
    The level 1 IF substatements are over 
    The level 1 ELSE substatements are:
        An IF statement nested at level 2, with the condition x<7
        The IF substatements are: 
            You assign the value x+1 to the variable x
        The level 2 conditional IF structure is over
    The level 1 conditional IF ELSE structure is over
The WHILE loop substatements are over
